Red BLack Trees
================
I have implemented Red Black Trees in C. The power point presentation and report have algorithms and flowcharts explaining the implementation. 
After understanding the properties of Red Black Trees, I implemented 4 different operations 
(i) Rotation
    + Right rotate
    + Left rotate
    + Left-Right rotate
    + Right-Left rotate
(ii)Insertion
(iii)Deletion
(iv) Search
    + Search for any given element
    + Search for minimum element
    + Search for maximum element
Through this project I have also explored the pros, cons and applications of Red Black Trees as detailed in the report.

Directory Layout
====================
The Red Black Trees directory structure looks as follows::

    E-commerce-Website-Django/
        |---RedBlackTrees.c
        |--EL.pptx
        |---EL_report.pdf
        |----readme.md
